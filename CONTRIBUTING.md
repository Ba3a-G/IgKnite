# Contribution Guidelines

We're glad to have you here with us in this project. Hope your ideas will shine in the whole workspace, and to do just that, we have written this comprehensive guide to help you set up, initialize and properly code on IgKnite.

When contributing to this repository, make sure to first discuss the change you wish to implement via [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/IgKniteDev/IgKnite/issues), [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/IgKniteDev/IgKnite/discussions), email, the official [Discord server](https://discord.gg/ftVPgrw54A) or directly with me ([**@hitblast**](https://github.com/hitblast)) before actually pushing it to your own fork or copy.

We also have a [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) in place so make sure to follow the given set of guidelines and thresholds while you interact with the project.

## Development Setup

Setting up a project from scratch can be a real pain, and that's why we have made [this chapter](https://igknition.ml/docs/development.html) inside our documentation for you to follow along and create your own features. Make sure to follow along and let your ideas come to life! <br>

## Pull Request / Commit Guideline

- IgKnite comes with pre-baked [Pull Request Templates](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/using-templates-to-encourage-useful-issues-and-pull-requests/about-issue-and-pull-request-templates) so that you can effortlessly create pull requests with the appropriate style.
- On the other hand, writing commit messages properly also helps explain your changes. Before the start of your commit messages, use an appropriate emoji given [here in Gitmoji](https://gitmoji.dev/) to let others know about your work in short.
