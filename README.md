IgKnite is a Discord bot built for the community, by the community. Written for stability and user-friendliness, IgKnite focuses on interaction-based commands rather than prefix-based commands (no `!play` anymore) to make moderating your server (and playing music) a breeze!

## ⚔️ Motive

Most Discord bots require a prefix (textual commands) and a clear head to use their commands. This can be intimidating at times, especially if you embarrass yourself in front of your friends by entering a command that isn't perfect. 

IgKnite, a Discord moderation and music bot built entirely on interactions such as slashes, buttons, views, selects, colors, and a slew of unique instructions, was created specifically for this purpose! <br>

## 📦 Mission

Our mission is to create a Discord bot which promotes ease-of-access for everyone with high-quality commands. Let it be the general members of a Discord server or the sole moderators, we aim to create an experience equally fluid for everyone. We also want to do it without never having to think about making IgKnite closed-source. Which means, this project will remain **open-source and free forever.** <br>

## ⚡ Features

- Moderation commands, made creative and easy.
- State-of-the-art music system (YouTube).
- Asynchronous code on top of the [disnake](https://github.com/DisnakeDev/disnake) API wrapper.
- A playground all by itself for creative commands.
- Fully open-source (including assets).
- No buzz, all buff! <br>

## 📝 Usage

IgKnite has its own [documentation webpage](https://igknitedev.github.io/docs) where you can learn about everything, starting from the commands to even self-hosting the bot on your local computer. <br>

## 🔨 Contributing

We're eagerly waiting for your contribution! :D <br>
