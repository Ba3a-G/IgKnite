## ‚öîÔ∏è Motive

Most Discord bots require a prefix (textual commands) and a clear head to use their commands. This can be intimidating at times, especially if you embarrass yourself in front of your friends by entering a command that isn't perfect. 

IgKnite, a Discord moderation and music bot built entirely on interactions such as slashes, buttons, views, selects, colors, and a slew of unique instructions, was created specifically for this purpose!

Despite its youth, IgKnite intends to grow alongside the community, focusing on the needs of the user base and adding anything that brings the user experience one step closer to being as fluid as possible. It also aims to reduce the overhead of using commands, allowing you to accomplish much more with a single interaction.
